# Assignment 4

import pickle

## Part 1 - Random Graph Identification

For the first part of this assignment you will analyze randomly generated graphs and determine which algorithm created them.


```python
P1_Graphs = pickle.load(open('A4_graphs','rb'))
P1_Graphs
```




    [<networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7ffb019037f0>,
     <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7ffb01903908>,
     <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7ffb01903940>,
     <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7ffb01903978>,
     <networkx.classes.graph.Graph at 0x7ffb019039b0>]



<br>
`P1_Graphs` is a list containing 5 networkx graphs. Each of these graphs were generated by one of three possible algorithms:
* Preferential Attachment (`'PA'`)
* Small World with low probability of rewiring (`'SW_L'`)
* Small World with high probability of rewiring (`'SW_H'`)

Anaylze each of the 5 graphs and determine which of the three algorithms generated the graph.

*The `graph_identification` function should return a list of length 5 where each element in the list is either `'PA'`, `'SW_L'`, or `'SW_H'`.*


```python
def graph_identification():
    methods = []
    for G in P1_Graphs:
        degrees = G.degree()
        degree_values = sorted(set(degrees.values()))
        degree_hist = [list(degrees.values()).count(i) / float(nx.number_of_nodes(G)) for i in degree_values]
        clustering = nx.average_clustering(G)
        shortest_path = nx.average_shortest_path_length(G)
        
        if len(degree_hist)>10:
            methods.append('PA')
        elif clustering < 0.1:
            methods.append('SW_H')
        else:
            methods.append('SW_L')
    return methods
graph_identification()
```




    ['PA', 'SW_L', 'SW_L', 'PA', 'SW_H']

## Part 2 - Company Emails

For the second part of this assignment you will be workking with a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.

The network also contains the node attributes `Department` and `ManagementSalary`.

`Department` indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and `ManagementSalary` indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary.


```python
G = nx.read_gpickle('email_prediction.txt')

print(nx.info(G))
```

    Name: 
    Type: Graph
    Number of nodes: 1005
    Number of edges: 16706
    Average degree:  33.2458


### Part 2A - Salary Prediction

Using network `G`, identify the people in the network with missing values for the node attribute `ManagementSalary` and predict whether or not these individuals are receiving a management position salary.

To accomplish this, you will need to create a matrix of node features using networkx, train a sklearn classifier on nodes that have `ManagementSalary` data, and predict a probability of the node receiving a management salary for nodes where `ManagementSalary` is missing.



Your predictions will need to be given as the probability that the corresponding employee is receiving a management position salary.

The evaluation metric for this assignment is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).

Your grade will be based on the AUC score computed for your classifier. A model which with an AUC of 0.88 or higher will receive full points, and with an AUC of 0.82 or higher will pass (get 80% of the full points).

Using your trained classifier, return a series of length 252 with the data being the probability of receiving management salary, and the index being the node id.

    Example:
    
        1       1.0
        2       0.0
        5       0.8
        8       1.0
            ...
        996     0.7
        1000    0.5
        1001    0.0
        Length: 252, dtype: float64

    def is_management(node):
        managementSalary = node[1]['ManagementSalary']

        elif managementSalary == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return None

    df['pr'] = pd.Series(nx.pagerank(G))
    df['is_management'] = pd.Series([is_management(node) for node in G.nodes(data=True)])
    df_train = df[~pd.isnull(df['is_management'])]
    df_test = df[pd.isnull(df['is_management'])]
    features = ['clustering', 'degree', 'degree_centrality', 'closeness', 'betweeness', 'pr']
    X_train = df_train[features]
    Y_train = df_train['is_management']

    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes = [10, 5], alpha = 5,
                       random_state = 0, solver='lbfgs', verbose=0)
    clf.fit(X_train_scaled, Y_train)
    test_proba = clf.predict_proba(X_test_scaled)[:, 1]
    return pd.Series(test_proba,X_test.index)

### Part 2B - New Connections Prediction

For the last part of this assignment, you will predict future connections between employees of the network. The future connections information has been loaded into the variable `future_connections`. The index is a tuple indicating a pair of nodes that currently do not have a connection, and the `Future Connection` column indicates if an edge between those two nodes will exist in the future, where a value of 1.0 indicates a future connection.


```python
future_connections = pd.read_csv('Future_Connections.csv', index_col=0, converters={0: eval})
future_connections.head(10)
```

Using network `G` and `future_connections`, identify the edges in `future_connections` with missing values and predict whether or not these edges will have a future connection.

To accomplish this, you will need to create a matrix of features for the edges found in `future_connections` using networkx, train a sklearn classifier on those edges in `future_connections` that have `Future Connection` data, and predict a probability of the edge being a future connection for those edges in `future_connections` where `Future Connection` is missing.



Your predictions will need to be given as the probability of the corresponding edge being a future connection.

The evaluation metric for this assignment is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).

Your grade will be based on the AUC score computed for your classifier. A model which with an AUC of 0.88 or higher will receive full points, and with an AUC of 0.82 or higher will pass (get 80% of the full points).

Using your trained classifier, return a series of length 122112 with the data being the probability of the edge being a future connection, and the index being the edge as represented by a tuple of nodes.
